Hi, my name is Gabriel Carvalho, I always have been a tech entusiast but never had the guts to throw myself at the programming and learn what I could.
With the pandemic I tried to change my life and pursue one of my lifelong dream, started to learn python language and have been studying and building personal projects, and looking for a job opportunity to show how much I can lear and contribute to both society and companies.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Django, Web Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Django, Pygame
